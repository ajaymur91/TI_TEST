THEORY:
1) TI vs BAR vs MBAR vs EXP
2) How are soft core potentials used in TI?
See article (Soft-Core Potentials in Thermodynamic Integration. Comparing One- and Two-Step Transformations)

CHECKS:
3) ghost vs independent na/cl (any difference in delta G?)
4) dependence of simulation time (convergence of delta G?)

FOR FASTER SIMULATIONS:
-----------------------------------
install gromacs mpi & gpu version using spack
